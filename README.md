The Orange Button Taxonomy Viewer is an in-development web application which allows Taxonomy Metadata to be browsed.

The application is composed of two parts:

* Vue.js front-end 
* Python FLASK back-end

Currently the operational procedures are in flux and is not in a documented state.  With this said run the viewer.py
python program for the back end and run the VUE application located in the web folder for the front end.  Both
follow the default process for running Python and VUE programs and should be self explanatory.  There is also an
in-progress disribution script which merges them together into a single application and although it may not fully
work without tweaking it could be used as a starting point.

Rudimentary unit tests are also available using pytest for the Python Code and Jest for the VUE code.  The tests will
be flushed out as development continues.

Finally more documentation will be made available as development continues.  In the meantime if you need help
please reach out on the [Orange Button Slack Channel](https://orange-button.slack.com/).
