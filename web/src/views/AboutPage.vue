                The Orange Button Taxonomy Viewer allows for Orange Button Entrypoints, Concepts, Types, and Units to be
                searched and displayed in a manner that is appropriate for either a non-technical business user or a
                technical user who is not an XBRL Expert.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently the Orange Button Taxonomy Viewer is in an Under Development status and not all features are
                available. It is not yet versioned.

                The Concepts Page is still under design. Please enjoy the other pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime if you need to access Concepts please use the Taxonomy Data Element Reference:
                <a
                        href="http://orangebutton.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Orange-Button-Data-Element-Reference.pdf"
                        target="_blank">
                    Link
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are trying to find a view of Concept Relationships an experimental viewer is available:
                <a
                        href="http://localhost:5001"
                        target="_blank">
                    Link
                </a>
                <br/>
                NOTE: Changes and features requests for this viewer are not necessarily possible to address
                since it relies on third party technology outside of OBTV project control.
                <br/>
                Please send feedback on whether the experimental viewer is helpful or distracting.
